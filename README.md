# Hi! I'm Heather
Computer Science Graduate | Software Engineering Minor | Aspiring Software Developer

I’m an early-career software developer passionate about building interactive, user-focused applications. I have experience with frontend and backend development, databases, and web frameworks, and I enjoy designing systems that are both intuitive and maintainable.

I’m excited to expand my skills in full-stack development, scalable systems, and modern web technologies, and I’m always looking for opportunities to learn new technologies and tackle real-world problems. I’m especially interested in projects that combine community, creativity, and thoughtful UX design.
